# Prostate-Cancer-Patch-Classification
Gleason grading system is a method to evaluate the severity of prostate cancer. Under a microscope, it standardized and classified the degree of abnormality into different levels. Traditionally, grading is carried out manually. However, manual classification has the problems of strong subjectivity and is not suitable for large-scale high-throughput analysis. That is also the reason why AI-assisted pathological grading is important. The project aims to develop an automated classification model using deep learning, categorizing prostate histology patches into five classes: benign (Stroma, Normal) and malignant (Gleason Patterns 3, 4, and 5). Based on a dataset of H&E-stained images, we implemented a Transfer Learning approach based on the ResNet-18 architecture. The significant challenge is class imbalance. The number of G5 patterns is far less than that of other graded images. To solve this problem, a Baseline phase is used to inverse frequency weighting, and an Optimization phase is employed to manual penalty weighting and learning rate scheduling. The final model demonstrates improved generalization and sensitivity towards critical malignant classes, providing a robust framework for computer-aided diagnosis.
